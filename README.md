Title: Non-Muslim Population Dashboard – Pakistan Hindu Council Data

Description:
This interactive dashboard was created using data from the Pakistan Hindu Council website to visualize the demographics of non-Muslim communities across Pakistan. The dashboard highlights key insights such as:

📌 Number of non-Muslim religions registered across provinces.

👥 Gender-wise distribution (male vs. female) by religion.

🕌 Top religions among non-Muslim communities (Hindu, Christian, Qadiani/Ahmedi, etc.).

🌍 Provincial breakdown of non-Muslim populations (Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, etc.).

The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using tools like Power BI. It aims to provide a clear, visual overview of minority religious communities in Pakistan to support research and policy understanding.

Tools Used:
Power BI
Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing)
